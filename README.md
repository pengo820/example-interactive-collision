## Features

Glitch Effect: The text "FUCK" is styled with a glitch animation that skews and changes color continuously. On hover, the animation speeds up for a more intense effect.
Particle System: 100 particles move across the screen with random initial velocities. They bounce off the edges of the viewport.
Mouse Interaction: Particles are repelled by the mouse cursor when it comes within a certain radius, creating a dynamic interaction.
Click Burst: Clicking anywhere on the page triggers a burst of 30 additional particles that radiate outward from the click point and fade out.
